    abstract = "In this paper a new method for the analysis of fingerprint images is presented. A Hexagonal Fourier Transform is applied that will classify fingerprints into whorls, loops and arches. The Hexagonal Fourier Transform allows the utilization of hexagonally sampled data and the extention of output data in a rectangular scheme, which is more convenient for treatment and interpretation. Results for fingerprint classification are given."
