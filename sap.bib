The Hexagonal Fourier Transform allows the utilization of hexagonally sampled data and the extention of output data in a rectangular scheme, which is more convenient for treatment and interpretation. Results for fingerprint classification are given.",

    abstract={In this paper, representations of the two-dimensional (2-D) signals are presented that reduce the computation of 2-D discrete hexagonal Fourier transforms (2-D DHFTs). The representations are based on the concept of the covering that reveals the mathematical structure of the transforms. Specifically, a set of unitary paired transforms is derived that splits the 2-D DHFT into a number of smaller one-dimensional (1-D) DFTs. Examples for the 8×4 and 16×8 hexagonal lattices are described in detail. The number of multiplications required for computing the 8×4- and 16×8-point DHFTs are equal 20 and 136, respectively. In the general N⩾8 case, the number of multiplications required to compute the 2N×N-point DHFT by the paired transforms equals N2 (log N-1)+N},

    abstract="Hexagonal aggregates are hierarchical arrangements of hexagonal cells. These hexagonal cells may be efficiently addressed using a scheme known as generalized balanced ternary for dimension 2, or GBT2. The objects of interest in this paper are digital images whose domains are hexagonal aggregates. We define a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) for such images. The main result of this paper is a radix-7, decimation-in-space fast Fourier transform (FFT) for images defined on hexagonal aggregates. The algorithm has complexity N log7 N. It is expressed in terms of the p-product, a generalization of matrix multiplication. Data reordering (also known as shuffle permutations) is generally associated with FFT algorithms. However, use of the p-product makes data reordering unnecessary.",
